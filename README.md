# Todo List

This project practices using Webpack to bundle and minify the files. The aim is to also practice OOP and the use of objects from JavaScript.

The todo list consists of different tabs for different projects and each todo has a title, description, due date and priority. It can also filter the todo's which are due today and this week. The data is currently stored in localStorage so that the users can access them even after leaving the page.

This project is part of The Odin Project, an open source course.
